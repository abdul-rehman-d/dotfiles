# Dotfiles
This repository contains my dotfiles and configuration files for various applications and tools I use. The goal is to have a consistent and portable setup across different machines.

## Installation
To install the dotfiles, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdul-rehman-d/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash
```
